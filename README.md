## Inspiration
Building a regular team-generator seemed too basic and easy, so I decided to build a fantasy team builder that would help create a Dungeons and Dragons party. 

## Description
This application is not currently working.  I did learn a significant amount through this failure though.  I learned how to approach a larger project.  I don't feel that my ambition is what led me down the wrong path here, but rather my approach.  Irregardless of the size/scope of the project, a developer's objectives and goals should be as compact and functional at first.  Take the time to lay a solid foundation, starting with one piece of functional code, from one end to the other.  Once that is functional and tested, then proceed to build upon that.  Don't build vertically, but horizontally at a slight incline, circling back to lay the next layer upon the previous layer.  This was uiltimatelly my downfall, as by the time I built the individual pieces, they no longer functioned as awhole program.
